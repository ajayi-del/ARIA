# ARIA — Claude Code Context

This file is loaded automatically when you run `claude` inside this project.
The full system architecture lives in ~/kingdom_prompt.md. This file adds project-specific context.

## This Project
- ARIA: autonomous perpetuals trading system on SoDEX mainnet
- Local path: /Users/dayodapper/CascadeProjects/ARIA/
- Server path: /home/dayodapper/ARIA/
- Git remote: https://github.com/ajayi-del/ARIA.git (branch: main)
- Server SSH: gcloud compute ssh aria-prod --zone=europe-west3-c
- Language: Python 3.12, tmux session: aria
- Test suite: python3 -m pytest tests/ -q (125 tests — all must pass before restart)
- Venv: .venv/bin/python -m pytest tests/ -v

## Key Files (ARIA)
  core/config.py              — all constants, thresholds, session params
  core/market_engine.py       — MicrostructureAnalyzer, signal computation
  core/risk_engine.py         — Kant gate, DrawdownGuard, recovery mode
  core/strategy_runner.py     — Nietzsche, signal→order pipeline
  core/chancellor.py          — Kingdom-level position governance
  execution/sodex_client.py   — EIP-712 signed order submission
  data/bybit_feed.py          — Bybit WS: candles, OB, liquidation
  data/ssi_feed.py            — SoSValue SSI WebSocket (MAG7/DEFI/MEME/US)
  display/terminal.py         — Live terminal UI
  vault/vault_manager.py      — Watermark, drawdown tracking
  agents/sovereign.py         — Yield-optimized spot agent (◆)
  monitoring/alerts.py        — Telegram alerts (not the Kimi bot)
  kingdom/chancellor.py       — Cross-agent Chancellor logic

## SoDEX Auth Rules
  GET  (balance, positions, orders): wallet 0xdb87899... in URL, NO X-API-Key
  POST/DELETE (orders, leverage):    X-API-Key = 0x36C54F... (signing key, not wallet)
  Min notional gate: $10 before exchange submission
  SOSO_STAKED=168 → 5% fee discount active

## Signal Architecture
  Tier 1: SoSValue SSI — sector rotation (MAG7SSI, DEFISSI, MEMESSI, USSI)
  Tier 2: Equity momentum / earnings
  Tier 3: Microstructure — sweep ratio, VPIN, stop cluster, order imbalance
  Tier 4: ValueChain cascade — eth_getLogs on-chain liquidation detection (THE EDGE)
  Tier 5: Funding rate regime
  Tier 6: SoDEX liquidation signal

  Signal flow: Raw → macro_applied → session_filter → quant_filter → Kant → Nietzsche → Chancellor → execution

## Regime & Sizing
  13-regime classifier — rank-based momentum, dispersion, coherence
  ATR: 5m for crypto (Bybit-seeded), 15m for equities
  Session multipliers: Asian=0.60x, London=0.85x, US=1.00x, Overlap=1.10x
  Recovery mode: 0.50x cap, floor raised to 5.6 coherence

## Bybit V5 TP/SL (for AUGUR — ARIA uses SoDEX)
  positionIdx: 0 (one-way mode)
  tpTriggerBy / slTriggerBy: "MarkPrice" — prevents wick fills
  Always: entry=mark_price passed to place_order

## Hard Rules For This Project
  1. Never touch tiers 1-6 signal logic without explicit instruction
  2. Never touch Kant, Nietzsche, or Chancellor engines without explicit instruction
  3. Never change leverage cap without explicit instruction
  4. Never restart with open positions — grep "open_positions" logs/aria.log | tail -3
  5. Always run tests before restart: python3 -m pytest tests/ -q
  6. Always show git diff before deploying to server
  7. Drawdown stored as PERCENT (8.0 = 8%) not decimal (0.08) — never mix scales

## Deploy Flow
  1. Edit local /Users/dayodapper/CascadeProjects/ARIA/
  2. git add -p && git commit -m "fix: <description>"
  3. git push origin main
  4. gcloud compute ssh aria-prod --zone=europe-west3-c
  5. cd ~/ARIA && git pull && tmux attach -t aria
  6. Restart: Ctrl+C, python3 main.py (only after grep confirms no open positions)
  7. Watch logs for 60s for expected events

## Known Issues (update as fixed)
  1. aria_stale_bets_purged fires per-symbol — move outside for loop
  2. velocity_zscore filter bypassed at zscore=6.0 — bypass if velocity_zscore > 3.0
  3. Liquidation notional in tokens not USD — notional_usd = size * price
  4. Min liq threshold too low ($75 pollutes window) — skip if notional_usd < 1000

## AI Model

  One operator. One server. Live capital. Build accordingly.
